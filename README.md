# Rental-data-anlaysis-with-Panel-data-regression_1
In this project, we analyzed rental data of 64 cities with respect to two different decades 1980 and 1990 with 8 features. This project was associated with our academic curriculum in Statical modeling for business analysis. In this project, we analyzed the data with different features like Income per capita of different cities, Percentage of students enrolled in the city, the total population of the city, and other features. we can understand that this project data was panel data so we applied different Panel data regression models to understand the relation between rent and different features of the data. We applied 4 different models -  OLS model- in this we applied a direct OLS model with data. Pooled Model Fixed Entity model Random Entity model In his model, we got rental data that was highly correlated with income per capita and we also found that population is showing any significance at a 95% confidence level. so we concluded that rental data did not affect students only the maybe omitted variables like the special status of the city, their infrastructure, Industrial growth, and much more, and these omitted variables highly related to income per capita that is why it shows a high correlation with rent.
